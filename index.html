        <div class="subheading mb-5">Political Science ðŸŒŽ </div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My professional experience ranges from marketing and management to business consulting and filmmaking. Iâ€™ve won several awards for my short films, and have taught social media classes for the families of veterans. Iâ€™ve been on the board of a nonprofit that strove to spread awareness about drinking and have helped a granite mining quarry in the southeastern part of southern south Asia to update their accounting practices from pen and paper records to cloud based platforms such as the Google Suite: Google Sheets, Google Docs, etc. Furthermore, I have also started a nonprofit to end homelessness in the Greater LA area, A roof for All.<br><br>

        Growing up in LA you become almost acclimated to the homelessness crisis all around you, but it wasnâ€™t until I volunteered here that I started to empathize with the situation. This inspired me to start my own nonprofit, A Roof for All, with the goal of ending homelessness in the greater LA area. I felt that this was needed since its niche of fighting food insecurity with the intent to make housing more accessible, was just not being focused on in the high school sphere; thousands of people eager to change their community were just not being utilized to tackle this particular issue. I began by organizing a group of friends and hosting food drives. Without the added stress of worrying about what theyâ€™d eat that night, people can focus on getting the resources they need to uplift themselves from their individual situations. After all, you canâ€™t have upwards social mobility on an empty stomach. As our following grew from a few dozen volunteers and supporters to hundreds from across southern California, so did our portfolio. Since then, weâ€™ve worked with a local farm to harvest fresh produce for people facing food insecurity and worked with Habitat LA to construct homes for low-income families in the region. Most recently, weâ€™ve held our annual RunToRoof fun-run fundraiser, the proceeds from which have been used to prepare hygiene kits, which our volunteers and I personally distributed to those on Skid-Row. As our initiative expandsâ€“whether that be working with employment agencies to connect more people to jobs or influencing local legislature - our initial goal remains; to give everyone the opportunity to have a roof over their head - something they can call their own. Growing up, Iâ€™ve always been independent, which can be seen by my work on YouTube. 
<br><br>

        I was so moved by that moment, meeting the people firsthand, that I was inspired to start a nonprofit to tackle the issue of homelessness in the greater LA area, with an emphasis on access to healthy food.

But Iâ€™ve also come to realize that while they act as effective bandaids to larger issues, nonprofits and coalitions alike can only do so much. applied for la city council so I can make a difference in the homeless community  so  they can also experience these moments where they have chances, and build on them. We need to pursue legislative reforms rather than temporary relief, change in our legislature offers a more long-term solution. 

Insead of putting a bandaid on a third degree burn, we can prevent them from happening in the first place. Iâ€™m also currently a candidate for Downtown LAâ€™s Neighborhood Council Elections this year, so I can do my part for the community both on the ground and hopefully through influencing our legislature as well.

Helped me realize that community service organization can only do so much to cover the rough patches, but to eliminate the problem we need legislation. More conscious of general stigma around the homeless community. So what did I do.. I built on that chance. 

Before this chance opportunity, I didnâ€™t see myself as a community-service type of person, frankly I didnâ€™t really know much about it. But, every once in a while, there are going to be moments - -  moments in our lives when we are provided with an opportunity, not because we asked for it, or wished for it, but entirely by chance. I urge you, when you face these chances, to build from them, something better; something no longer simply by chance, but because that was what you decided to do with your moment.
